# Guitar Fretboard Mastery (Fret Science System)

A systematic approach to guitar theory emphasizing geometric patterns and understanding over rote memorization.

## Core Concept: The Warp

The most important fretboard concept: **the G-B string boundary shifts patterns by one fret**.

- Standard tuning uses perfect 4ths (5 semitones) between strings, EXCEPT G-to-B which is a major 3rd (4 semitones)
- Any pattern crossing G↔B shifts one fret toward the bridge (G→B) or toward the nut (B→G)
- This explains why chord shapes change when moved across strings

## Pentatonic Scale: Rectangle & Stack

The pentatonic scale is a **5-string repeating pattern** with two geometric shapes:

### The Rectangle (Red)
- Two notes on adjacent strings spanning 3 frets each
- Contains: 1, 5, b3, b7 (minor) or 6, 3, 1, 5 (major)
- Both right-hand notes can be bent a full step

### The Stack (Blue)  
- Three adjacent strings with 2-fret intervals
- Contains: b3, b7, 4, 1, 5 (minor) or 1, 5, 2, 6, 3 (major)
- Top-right corner bends full step; lower-right notes bend 1.5 steps

### Navigation
- Rectangle and stack **alternate vertically** in each pentatonic form
- Rectangle and stack **alternate horizontally** with slight diagonal descent
- Stack connects diagonally to itself one octave higher (Clapton pathway)

### Five Forms
All forms derive from shifting the 5-string repeating pattern up strings (accounting for warp):
Form 1 → Form 4 → Form 2 → Form 5 → Form 3 → Form 1

## Modes: Pentatonic + Fill-in Notes

Six modes are pentatonic scales with two notes added inside the rectangle:

| Mode       | Type  | Fill Position | Brightness |
|------------|-------|---------------|------------|
| Lydian     | Major | Both right    | Brightest  |
| Ionian     | Major | Staggered     | Medium     |
| Mixolydian | Major | Both left     | Darker     |
| Dorian     | Minor | Both right    | Brightest  |
| Aeolian    | Minor | Staggered     | Medium     |
| Phrygian   | Minor | Both left     | Darkest    |

Locrian (b5) doesn't fit this system—it's not built on major/minor pentatonic.

### Brightness Order (each differs by one semitone)
Lydian (#4) → Ionian → Mixolydian (b7) → Dorian (b3,b7) → Aeolian (b3,b6,b7) → Phrygian (b2,b3,b6,b7) → Locrian

## 3nps (Three-Notes-Per-String)

A 7-string universal pattern with only **3 fingering shapes**:
- **1-2-4** (half-whole): Scale degrees 7, 3
- **1-3-4** (whole-half): Scale degrees 6, 2  
- **1-3-5** (whole-whole): Scale degrees 5, 1, 4

### Phone Numbers for String Movement
- Going UP: 7-3-6-2-5-1-4
- Going DOWN: 4-1-5-2-6-3-7

Pattern 4→7 transition shifts one fret (can combine with warp for 2-fret shift).

### String Pairs (for horizontal movement)
Memorize the 7 pairs—great for melodic sequences:
- Pair 1: 4/1 → 5/2 → 6/3 (same shape as Pair 5)
- Pairs 2-7 follow sequentially

## CAGED System

Five open chord shapes (C-A-G-E-D) become a **pegboard** for the entire fretboard.

### Root Locations
Memorize where roots fall in each CAGED shape—snap any pattern onto these positions.

### Layered Hierarchy (for improvisation)
1. **Root** — Home base, most stable
2. **Triad** (1-3-5) — Always consonant, great phrase endings
3. **Pentatonic** — Adds melodic options
4. **Mode** — Full color palette

## Triads

### Four Types (stacked thirds)
| Triad      | Formula   | Lower 3rd | Upper 3rd |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Major      | 1-3-5     | Major (4) | Minor (3) |
| Minor      | 1-b3-5    | Minor (3) | Major (4) |
| Diminished | 1-b3-b5   | Minor (3) | Minor (3) |
| Augmented  | 1-3-#5    | Major (4) | Major (4) |

### Inversions
- Root position: 1-3-5
- 1st inversion: 3-5-1
- 2nd inversion: 5-1-3

Nine closed-form shapes exist (3 inversions × 3 string groups, warped versions for G-B crossing).

### Quick Modifications
From Major: lower 3rd → minor, raise 5th → augmented, lower root 1 fret → maj7, lower root 2 frets → dom7
From Minor: raise 3rd → major, lower 5th → diminished, lower root 2 frets → m7

## Intervals

### Counting System
- Horizontal: +1 fret toward bridge, -1 toward nut
- Vertical: +5 per string up (toward floor), -5 per string down
- **Warp crossing**: count diagonally

### Reference Table
| Semitones | Interval | Semitones | Complement |
|-----------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 0         | Unison   | 12        | Octave     |
| 1         | m2       | 11        | M7         |
| 2         | M2       | 10        | m7         |
| 3         | m3       | 9         | M6         |
| 4         | M3       | 8         | m6         |
| 5         | P4       | 7         | P5         |
| 6         | #4/b5    | 6         | Tritone    |

9th = 2nd, 11th = 4th, 13th = 6th (subtract 7)

## Harmonization with Thirds

### Which Scale Degrees Get Major/Minor Thirds
- **Major thirds** (4 frets): 1, 4, 5
- **Minor thirds** (3 frets): 2, 3, 6, 7

### Technique
1. Play melody on one string
2. Add third on adjacent string (major or minor based on scale degree)
3. Keep one finger anchored, shift other finger for major/minor

### Spread Thirds with Pedal Tone
Capture open string as pedal, play thirds 2+ strings away. Assign scale degree to the note matching the open string to create any modal sound.

## Circle of 4ths/5ths

### Vertical Movement
Moving up a string = up a 4th (clockwise on circle)
Moving down a string = down a 4th (counterclockwise)

### The Sequence
4ths: B-E-A-D-G-C-F-Bb-Eb-Ab-Db-Gb
5ths: Reverse order with sharp names

Wraps diagonally around fretboard due to warp.

## Fretboard Memorization Exercises

1. **Combine with pentatonic**: Find note everywhere using octave jumps, build pentatonic each time
2. **Follow progressions**: Find roots and build triads for each chord in a song
3. **Cycle of 4ths on one string**: Play B-E-A-D-G-C-F-Bb-Eb-Ab-Db-Gb
4. **Chromatic one-note-per-string**: Move chromatically while changing strings

## Octave Shapes (CAGED Backbone)

Two "chess moves" for octave jumps:
- +2 strings, +2 frets (no warp) → +3, +2 with warp
- +2 strings, -3 frets (no warp) → +2, -3 with warp

These shapes connect CAGED positions.
