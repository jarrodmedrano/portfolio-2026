# Player Psychology

Understanding why players play and what they expect is fundamental to good game design.

## Why Do Players Play?

### 1. Challenge

Players enjoy games because they provide challenges that engage the mind differently than other media. Like solving a Rubik's Cube, games force players to:
- Think actively
- Try different solutions
- Understand game mechanisms
- Learn through experimentation

**Key insight**: Players are enriched by the learning that follows overcoming challenges. They may apply problem-solving methods to work, use improved spatial skills in life, or learn greater empathy through role-playing.

### 2. Socialization

Gaming arose as a communal activity millennia ago. Most non-computer games require a social group to function—chess, Monopoly, bridge, Scrabble. The social element is more important than many designers realize:

- **Multi-player action games**: Even in high-velocity games like Quake, players still try to chat, demonstrating the desire to socialize
- **Persistent worlds**: MUDs and MMOs draw players primarily for social interaction—many players would never play single-player games
- **The human advantage**: Human opponents are unpredictable and challenging, but more importantly, they make the experience social

### 3. Dynamic Solitary Experience

Sometimes players want interactive engagement without social demands:
- Friends aren't available
- Tired of talking to people
- Want something that reacts like a human without the annoyances
- Always in control—can start and stop at any time

**Key insight**: Single-player games "fake" the interesting part of human interaction while letting players remain in control.

### 4. Bragging Rights

Particularly in multi-player gaming, players play to win respect:
- High score tables in arcades
- Being able to defeat all your friends
- Sense of self-satisfaction from victory
- Proving they can do something well

**Key insight**: Players who may not excel at sports or academics can find mastery and pride in games.

### 5. Emotional Experience

Players seek emotional payoff:
- **Simple emotions**: Adrenaline rush, tension of action games
- **Complex emotions**: Loss when a companion character sacrifices themselves
- **Catharsis**: Tragedy and despair can be compelling (arcade games are "lessons in defeat")

**Key insight**: Many games' emotional range is limited to excitement/tension, despair at failure, and elation at success. There's vast unexplored emotional territory.

### 6. Fantasy

Games enable escapism and role-playing:
- Become someone more exciting
- Live glamorous lives without mundane details (no eating, sleeping, bathroom breaks)
- Engage in socially unacceptable behavior safely (being a criminal in a game)
- See the world through someone else's eyes
- Explore "what if" scenarios (historical what-ifs)

**Key insight**: The level of fantasy immersion is heightened by interactivity—players don't just watch adventures, they have them.

## What Do Players Expect?

Once players start playing, they have gameplay expectations. Failing to meet these causes frustration.

### Consistent World

Players must be able to predict what actions produce what results:
- Same cause → same effect
- If a kick works in one situation, it should work in similar situations
- Failure should have perceivable reasons

**Example**: In fighting games, if a kick misses, it must be because the opponent jumped, blocked, or was too far away—reasons the player can perceive.

**Pinball problem**: Novice players can't see the connection between their actions and outcomes, so they call it "luck" and stop playing.

### Understanding the Game-World's Bounds

Players need to know what actions are possible vs. impossible:
- In Doom, players know they can't negotiate with demons
- Don't introduce entirely new mechanisms late in the game
- Players learn "how this game works" and expect that to remain true

**Violation example**: If Doom suddenly required befriending a monster through conversation, players would be frustrated—that's completely outside the established scope.

### Reasonable Solutions to Work

Once players understand the game, their reasonable solution attempts should succeed:
- Real-world problems have multiple solutions
- Games modeling reality should too
- The designer provides one solution, but must anticipate alternatives

**Key insight**: Every "You can't do that" or failed reasonable attempt breaks immersion and frustrates players.

### Direction

Players need goals and some idea how to achieve them:
- Without a goal, there's no game
- Without knowing the goal, might as well not have one
- Need direction without feeling hand-held

**SimCity exception**: Players impose their own goals based on real-world understanding of "what makes a good city." The game's grounding in reality provides implicit direction.

### Incremental Accomplishment

Players want to feel progress:
- Provide sub-goals along the way
- Reward achievement of sub-goals proportionally
- Without positive reinforcement, players will abandon the correct path

### Immersion

Anything that reminds players they're "just playing a game" damages the experience:
- Bugs and crashes
- Puzzles with solutions that don't work (even if reasonable)
- Characters they can't identify with
- UI elements that feel artificial

**Character identification**: Mario works because he's a blank slate. Characters with annoying personalities constantly remind players they're not in control.

### Failure is Expected

Players expect to fail sometimes—it's part of the challenge. But failure should feel fair.

### Fair Chance

Players expect the game to give them an opportunity to succeed:
- Difficulty should come from the challenge, not hidden information
- Don't require precognition
- Provide tools and information needed to make progress

### Not Repeating Themselves

Players hate redoing completed work:
- Save systems should be generous
- Don't punish players by making them replay large sections
- Respect the player's time

### Not Getting Hopelessly Stuck

Players need escape routes:
- Multiple solutions prevent dead ends
- Hints for struggling players
- "Non-linearity is about preventing players from getting stuck"

### To Do, Not Watch

Players play games for interactivity:
- Every non-interactive moment is time they could be playing
- Cut-scenes should be skippable
- The more passive content, the less it's a game

**Key insight**: Players who wanted passive entertainment would have watched a movie.

## Player Types: The Audience Consideration

Not all players want the same thing. Consider your target audience:

| Player Type | Primary Motivation | Design Consideration |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Hardcore Gamer | Challenge, Mastery | Complex systems, high difficulty |
| Social Player | Connection | Multi-player, sharing features |
| Casual Player | Relaxation, Fantasy | Simple controls, forgiving difficulty |
| Explorer | Discovery | Hidden content, non-linear worlds |
| Achiever | Completion | Clear goals, rewards, collections |
| Storyteller | Narrative | Rich characters, meaningful choices |

**Critical insight**: You cannot please everyone. Better to delight some players deeply than satisfy all players marginally.
