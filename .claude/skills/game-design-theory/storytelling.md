# Storytelling in Games

Stories can make games stronger, but only when employed properly.

## The Core Tension

> "The danger for designers is that they get hooked into their story, and they forget that storytelling is a linear narrative-type thing. And the more you flesh out the story the more you remove the interactivity, and the more you remove the player from the game. It's kinda like 'Oh, the outcome has already been determined. So what's the point?'" — Eugene Jarvis

## Designer's Story vs. Player's Story

### Designer's Story
Predetermined dramatic events, like a novel or film:
- Static and unchanging regardless of player actions
- Conveyed between gameplay sections (cut-scenes, briefings)
- Limited branching, each branch pre-authored
- Only endings: success or failure

### Player's Story
Unique narrative generated by how each player plays:
- Different every playthrough
- Shaped by player decisions and tactics
- The story players are most invested in
- Often more personally meaningful than designer's story

**Example (Command & Conquer)**: The player remembers how they lost their initial forces to Flamethrower Infantry, found Tiberium, built tanks, and finally crushed the enemy. This player's story matters more to them than the FMV cut-scene that follows.

### The Ideal

Merge designer's story and player's story:
- Player impacts story while story retains dramatic qualities
- Designer anticipates player questions and actions
- Multiple play styles accommodated
- Player feels authorship over a well-crafted narrative

**Analogy 1 - Parent telling child a story**:
- Parent has story in mind (characters, surprises, rough direction)
- Child asks questions: "What color was the newt?"
- Parent adapts: "A strange shade of yellow, like royal mustard..."
- Story develops through collaboration

**Analogy 2 - Dungeon Master**:
- DM plans locations, NPCs, conflicts
- Players control actions and conversations
- DM responds dynamically, never saying "The NPC doesn't understand"
- Story emerges from interaction

## Places for Storytelling

### Out-of-Game
Storytelling when player isn't playing:
- Cut-scenes (player loses character control)
- Mission briefings between levels
- Opening/ending cinematics

**Advantages**: Uses established cinematic techniques; easier to execute than in-game storytelling.

**Disadvantages**: Disrupts interactivity; if gameplay is good, players want to return to it.

### In-Game
Storytelling during gameplay:
- Level settings and environment
- NPC behaviors and dialogue
- Interactive conversations
- Signs, notes, graffiti
- Radio/PA announcements
- Player-controlled terminals

**Advantages**: Maintains immersion; player feels like participant, not observer.

**Disadvantages**: Player might miss story elements; requires more design work.

### External Materials
Storytelling outside the computer:
- Manual backstory
- Physical maps or props
- Collectible items in packaging

Mostly historical now (space constraints of early games). Generally frowned upon today—story should be in the game itself.

## Problems with Out-of-Game Storytelling

### The Visual Disconnect
Early FMV cut-scenes looked nothing like gameplay:
- Live actors in video vs. simple sprites in-game
- High-polygon pre-rendered 3D vs. real-time graphics
- Breaks suspension of disbelief

**Solution**: Use the game engine for cut-scenes (like Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Drakan). Less "pretty," but seamlessly immersive.

### The Interactivity Gap
Movies don't stop for you to read a book. Why do games stop for you to watch a movie?

Games mix media unnaturally—forcing players to read, watch, then finally play.

### Non-Skippable Cut-Scenes
**Unforgivable**: Forcing players to watch cut-scenes.

**Better**: Let players skip entirely.

**Best**: Let players control playback—pause, rewind, fast-forward. They're a single-person audience, not a theater crowd.

**The Last Express innovation**: Players could turn back game-time like rewinding a clock, rewatching any story moment.

## In-Game Storytelling Techniques

### Text in the World
- Signs with directions
- Notes left by previous inhabitants
- Graffiti on walls
- Books lying around

### Level Settings
Environment tells story without words:
- Destroyed villages show conflict history
- Opulent mansions show wealth
- Abandoned equipment shows what happened here

Don't tell players the land is run-down—show them the run-down land.

### NPC Dialogue
Can be interactive (multiple choice, typed response) or ambient (NPCs talking during gameplay).

**Half-Life success**: Scientists chatting, PA announcements, never taking control from player.

### NPC Behaviors
Actions speak louder than words:
- Two enemy races should fight each other if they meet
- Peaceful villagers flee if player draws weapons
- Hostile towns draw weapons when threatened

**Scripted behaviors for atmosphere**:
- Townsperson receiving unjust beating from police → shows oppression
- Market bustle → shows prosperity
- Furtive whispers → shows fear

### The Marathon Approach
Computer terminals scattered through levels:
- Walk up and press "action"
- Read text screens (player-controlled, can flip back and forth)
- World still active while reading—can be attacked!
- Maintains tension while delivering story

### Damage Incorporated Approach
Interactive mission briefings:
- Arrow keys flip between documents
- Spoken dialog supplements written material
- Tape deck controls: pause, rewind, fast-forward
- Players read and listen at their own pace

## "Show, Don't Tell"

Just like good creative writing:
- In-game storytelling = showing
- Cut-scenes = telling

When players experience story themselves rather than being told second-hand, immersion increases dramatically.

---

## The Missing Story Problem

What if players miss story elements in in-game storytelling?

**Designer response**: "I need cut-scenes to guarantee players see everything!"

**Better perspective**: 
- If players skip story, that's their choice—games are interactive
- Discovering story on replay adds value
- Different "layers" of story for different play styles

The player who charges through gets action; the explorer gets lore.

## Frustrated Linear Writers

### The Hollywood Envy Problem
Some game writers wish they were screenwriters:
- Apply linear techniques to interactive medium
- Emphasize "cinematic" nature
- Create "interactive movies"
- Cut-scenes grow longer and longer
- Predetermined story dominates gameplay

### The Medium's Youth
Early films were documented stage plays—camera on tripod, no cuts, no movement. Filmmakers hadn't discovered their medium's unique voice.

Games are similarly young. We're still learning what games do best that other media can't.

**Key insight**: Don't try to make games into movies. Discover what games alone can achieve.

## Story Integration Checklist

For each story element, ask:

1. **Does it need to interrupt gameplay?** If not, deliver in-game.
2. **Can the player control the pacing?** Pause, rewind, skip?
3. **Does it use the same visual style as gameplay?** Maintains immersion.
4. **Could this be shown through environment/behavior instead of told through dialogue/text?**
5. **What if the player misses this?** Is that acceptable? Is there redundancy?
6. **Does this serve player agency or override it?**

## The Dream

> Imagine all the power of a story in a novel... Now imagine how much more powerful that would be if, instead of reading about the actions of other characters, the reader was the main character and was able to make choices that would affect the shape, direction, and outcome of the story.

This dream—truly interactive stories that rival the emotional impact of the best literature—is still distant. But it provides a compelling reason to keep experimenting.
