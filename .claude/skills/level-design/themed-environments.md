# Themed Level Environments

Based on Chapter 5: "Hell, Hyboria, and Disneyland" by Scott Rogers.

## The Evolution of Themed Levels

Themed video game levels are environments designed to a particular subject matter, bringing together: character, location, story, enemies, mechanics, hazards, art, events, and music.

> "These themed levels are the playgrounds of our dreams."

## The Ten Classic Tropes

### 1. Outer Space
**Origin:** Spacewar! (1961) and the black CRT screen

**Why it works:**
- Black screens naturally suggest space
- Vector-drawn stars look great on CRTs
- Simple geometric ships (no animation needed)
- Physics-based gameplay natural
- Infinite bounds make sense

**Modern usage:** Star Fox, Geometry Wars, space stations

---

### 2. Fire and Ice
**Origin:** Dragon's Lair (1983) for fire; Ghost 'N Goblins (1984) for ice

**Why they work:**
- Killing with fire = collision box + art overlay (cheap to implement)
- Low-friction surfaces = physics tweak
- Perfect timing puzzles (break player rhythm)
- Wide array of thematic enemies
- Strong color palette (red/blue) for visual distinction

**Design advantages:**
- Fire: Lava pits, flame jets, fire-breathing enemies
- Ice: Slippery surfaces, icicle hazards, yetis, hypothermia

---

### 3. Dungeon/Cavern/Tomb
**Origin:** Colossal Cave Adventure (1976), Rogue (1980)

**Why it works:**
- Tileable wall textures (memory efficient)
- Traps without explanation needed
- Treasure without justification needed
- Easily repeatable art assets
- Expected danger creates tension

**Modern usage:** Every RPG ever, roguelikes, action-adventures

---

### 4. Factory
**Origin:** Donkey Kong (1981), Modern Times (1936 film influence)

**Why it works:**
- Moving obstacle courses
- Easily combined and repurposed hazards
- Scalable difficulty through speed/complexity
- Mechanics adaptable to any setting

**Factory mechanics in non-factories:**
- Moving platforms (tombs, space stations)
- Conveyer belts (any industrial setting)
- Turning gears (clockwork, machinery)

**Modern usage:** Super Mario Galaxy, Little Big Planet

---

### 5. Jungle
**Origin:** Pitfall! (1982)

**Creation story:**
> "I drew a stick figure... put him on a path... Where is the path? Let's put it in a jungle. Why is he running? [draw treasures, enemies]" — David Crane

**Why it works:**
- Flexibility of dungeons without dull colors
- Exotic traps (quicksand, pits)
- Exotic creatures (crocodiles, snakes, scorpions)
- Colorful outdoor environment
- Fluid movement (vines, branches, logs)

**Mechanics:** Swinging vines, tree platforms, rivers with moving logs

**Modern usage:** Crysis, Uncharted

---

### 6. Spooky
**Origin:** Haunted House (1972 electromechanical), Ghost 'N Goblins (1984)

**Why it works:**
- Perfect for mood and story
- Most adaptable trope
- Combines easily with any other theme

**Spooky combinations:**
- Space + Spooky = Derelict spacecraft
- Fire + Spooky = Hell
- Urban + Spooky = Haunted city

**The survival horror genre:** Sweet Home (1989) → Resident Evil, Silent Hill

---

### 7. Pirate
**Origin:** Pirates of the Caribbean (Disneyland attraction, 1967)

**Why it works:**
- High-action gameplay ready
- Melee combat natural
- Treasure = clear rewards
- Ships = interesting level geometry
- Always pairs well with spooky (skeleton pirates)

**Genre spread:** Simulation (Sid Meier's Pirates), platformer (Hook), action (Black Kat), puzzle (Zack & Wiki)

---

### 8. Gritty Urban
**Origin:** Double Dragon (1987), influenced by Streets of Fire (1984)

**Why it works:**
- Real-world familiarity
- Players understand context immediately
- Modern stand-in for dungeon exploration
- Can be improved or destroyed by player

**The gangster game genre:** GTA, Saints Row
- Sandbox worlds modeled on real cities
- Player choice: improve or destroy

---

### 9. Space Station
**Origin:** Major Havoc (1983)

**Why it works:**
- Sci-fi dungeon equivalent
- Tech-based mechanics (force fields, airlocks)
- Alien/robot enemies expected
- Spectacular visual effects possible

**Influence:** Aliens (1986 film) → System Shock, Halo, Dead Space

---

### 10. Sewer
**Origin:** Mario Bros. (1983)

**Creation:** Miyamoto was told his character looked more like a plumber than a carpenter. He put Mario in "a crab/turtle/firefly-infested sewer."

**Why it works:**
- Modern dungeon stand-in
- Deadly hazards (rats, alligators, toxic water)
- Factory mechanics (fans, platforms)
- Pipes provide entrance/exit points

**Modern usage:** Metal Gear Solid, Oblivion, Left 4 Dead

## The Mexican Pizza Technique

**Definition:** Combine two different tropes to create something fresh.

**Origin story:**
> "In 2001, Taco Bell introduced the Mexican pizza... Growing up in San Diego, I knew what Mexican food was and... what pizza was. But what the heck was a Mexican pizza?"

### Examples

| Combination | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Fire + Graveyard | Maximo: Ghosts to Glory |
| Jungle + Urban | The Last of Us, Enslaved |
| Pirate + Zombie | Plants vs. Zombies 2 |
| Space + Sewer | Aliens-style vent crawling |
| Medieval + Hell | Dante's Inferno |

### Why It Works
- Players recognize familiar elements
- Combination creates novelty
- Mechanics from both themes available
- Visual distinctiveness

## The Disneyland Influence

### Themed Lands Concept
Walt Disney's park design philosophy:
> "I don't want the public to see the real world they live in while they're in the park. I want them to feel like they are in another world."

### Dark Ride Design
Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion:
- Temperature-controlled environments
- Vehicles directing view
- Audio-animatronics synchronized to tracks
- Complete immersion in artificial worlds

### Application to Games
- Complete thematic consistency
- Every element supports the theme
- Transitions between areas managed carefully
- Player as "guest" experiencing designed journey

---

## The Hyboria Model

Robert E. Howard's Conan world: Ancient civilizations packed into a compact continent.

**Design advantages:**
- Travel time compressed
- Any culture accessible
- Themed regions with distinct identities

**D&D Influence:** Dungeons & Dragons adopted themed worlds → influenced video games → Gauntlet, Everquest, World of Warcraft

---

## Boss Enemies and Themed Levels

### The Megaman Pattern
Boss enemies' lairs match their appearances:
- Fire Man lives in volcanic furnace
- Ice Man lives in frigid lair
- Bubble Man lives underwater

### Design Synergy
- Boss inspires level theme
- Level theme supports boss mechanics
- Player expectations set by environment
- Thematic consistency reinforces both

---

## Building Believable Worlds

### Sustaining Disbelief
> "An important part about building a fantasy world is sustaining disbelief. Some of the best games... have one thing in common; you feel like the world was there despite you."

### World-Building Questions
- Why does this environment exist?
- Who built/shaped it?
- What happened here before the player arrived?
- What would happen if the player never came?

---

## Summary

1. **Classic tropes exist for practical reasons** — Technical advantages, clear mechanics
2. **Combine tropes for freshness** — Mexican Pizza technique
3. **Disneyland model** — Complete thematic immersion
4. **Boss/level synergy** — Environment and enemy reinforce each other
5. **World consistency** — Environment should feel like it exists independent of player
