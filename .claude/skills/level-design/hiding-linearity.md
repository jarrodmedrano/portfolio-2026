# Hiding Linearity in Level Design

Based on Chapter 10: "The Illusion of Choice" by João Raza and Benjamin Carter.

## Core Principle

A successful narrative-driven game must sustain the illusion of free will. The designer's job is to hide the contrivances of level design—go down *this* corridor, open *this* door—without making players feel their hand is forced.

> "The illusion of motion in film is a trick of the brain that works every time. Hiding the artifice in a game depends on distraction and psychological suggestion."

## Coerced Progression

The simplest approach: give players no time to question their path.

### Time Pressure
- Scrolling screens that push players forward (Super Mario Bros. 3 airship levels)
- Collapsing environments
- Pursuing enemies (Half-Life 2 opening)

### The Call of Duty Stalingrad Technique
Players queue for ammunition but are pushed onto the battlefield unarmed. Retreat means death from commanding officers. Players are too busy surviving to question direction.

**Key insight**: When players are struggling to stay alive, they don't debate whether to backtrack.

## Environmental Guidance

### Signage Systems
- Painted arrows, floor markings
- Color-coded paths (Mirror's Edge red highlights)
- In-world signs that make sense contextually

### Half-Life Approach
Opening sequence has players navigate benign corridors. Security guards provide narrative excuses for blocked paths ("You don't have clearance"). Players follow painted lines to destinations—feeling like navigation, not railroading.

### Highway 17 (Half-Life 2)
The level is literally a road. Players know the destination is at the end of Highway 17. The road always leads forward. Simple, elegant, invisible guidance.

## NPC-Based Guidance

### Escort Missions
Vulnerable NPCs guide players while needing protection:
- NPCs unlock doors players cannot (Half-Life retinal scanners)
- NPCs know the route and lead the way
- Players feel protective, not led

### Companion Characters
- Alyx Vance (Half-Life 2) guides without feeling like a guide
- Ellie (The Last of Us) comments when players idle too long or explore pointlessly
- Companions create social pressure to move forward

### The Chase
Instead of following a guide, chase an enemy:
- Mirror's Edge: Faith chases an equally-capable enemy
- Creates urgency without pursuit threat
- Tarrying means losing the target

## Narrative Lures

### Visual Objectives
- Distant landmarks that players want to reach
- Lit areas drawing attention through darkness
- Unique architecture standing out from environment

### Architectural Hierarchy
Important paths should be:
- More visually interesting
- Better lit
- More open
- Feature unique elements

Dead ends should be:
- Visually less interesting
- Darker
- Narrower
- More generic

### The Door Metaphor
- Open doors invite
- Locked doors close off
- But make sure locked doors have narrative justification

---

## What Breaks the Illusion

### Arbitrary Barriers
| Bad Example | Why It Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| Yellow police tape | A superhero can't cross tape? |
| Waist-high walls | Player can jump buildings but not fences |
| Locked doors without context | Why is this door special? |
| Invisible walls | No explanation at all |

### Better Alternatives
- Natural barriers (cliffs, water, fire)
- Narrative barriers (guards, lockdowns, collapsed structures)
- Overwhelming force (too many enemies in wrong direction)
- Environmental hazards (radiation, toxic air)

## The Forced Choice

When there's only one real option, design the moment so players interpret constraint as choice.

### P.T. Bathroom Example
The player is trapped in the bathroom. The door is mechanically locked—player can't open it. But because the handle rattles as if something's trying to get in, players feel like they're *hiding*, not *trapped*.

> "The game creates a situation where there's a particular action we want to take. It then responds as though we had done what we wanted to do, even though there's no way for us to do it."

### RPG Main Quests
Players feel they *choose* to storm the castle and rescue the princess. In reality, there's no other option. The illusion of agency is enough.

---

## Branching Illusions

### The Fork Technique
1. Present players with two paths
2. As player approaches one, block it (enemies appear, door locks, explosion)
3. Player "chooses" the remaining path
4. Both paths lead to the same destination anyway

### The Hub-and-Spoke
Players can explore "freely" but:
- All paths return to a central hub
- True progress gates require specific items/actions
- Exploration feels optional but forward path is singular

---

## Audio and Attention Cues

### Sound Design
- Distant sounds draw attention toward objectives
- Ambient audio creates "safe" vs "dangerous" zones
- Music intensifies toward correct paths

### Lighting
- Brighter areas feel more inviting
- Players naturally move toward light
- Use darkness to discourage wrong paths

---

## Testing Linearity Hiding

### Player Observation
Watch for:
- Players commenting on feeling "on rails"
- Players attempting to go backward or off-path
- Frustration at barriers
- Questions about why paths are blocked

### Successful Hiding
Players should:
- Feel like they're exploring
- Not notice most blocked paths
- Accept narrative barriers without question
- Report feeling "in control"

## Summary Framework

1. **Time pressure** eliminates questioning
2. **Environmental cues** guide without forcing
3. **NPCs** provide social and narrative direction
4. **Narrative lures** pull players forward
5. **Forced choices** feel like agency
6. **Barriers need justification**—narrative or natural

The goal isn't to give players freedom—it's to make them *feel* free while experiencing your intended sequence.
