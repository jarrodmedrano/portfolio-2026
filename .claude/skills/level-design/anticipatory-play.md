# Anticipatory Play & Horror Level Design

Based on Chapter 9: "P.T. and the Play of Stillness" by Brian Upton.

## Core Insight

Horror games are scary not because of what happens, but because of what players **imagine** will happen. The best horror level design creates **anticipatory play**—moments of stillness where players' minds race with possibilities.

> "We don't win a scary game by overcoming its challenges. We win by allowing it to thwart us."

## The Five Principles of Anticipatory Play

### 1. Invitation
Create situations where players feel invited to engage with ambiguity. Visible choices with unclear outcomes.

### 2. Elaboration
Choices should have clear, elaborated consequences. If you take path A, you can imagine what might happen.

### 3. Predictability
Some outcomes should be predictable—players need anchors to build expectations from.

### 4. Uncertainty
But not everything predictable. The tension between knowing and not-knowing creates anticipation.

### 5. Satisfaction
Even in horror, players need to feel resolution is possible. "Maybe this is it!" beats "I have no idea."

## The P.T. Level Analysis

### The Layout
A simple L-shaped corridor, looped infinitely:
- Entrance door (one-way ratchet)
- First half: visible, safe-feeling
- Corner: hides second half
- Second half: where bad things happen
- Bathroom door: sometimes open, sometimes locked
- Exit door (valve): blocks or allows progress
- Front door: permanently locked—visible escape that's impossible

### The Corner

The most important element in the entire game.

**Why corners work:**
- Binary: Can't see around them, then can
- Analog: You can peek, retreat, approach slowly
- Ambiguous: Anything could be waiting
- Controllable: Player chooses when to turn

> "Just walking toward the corner and making the turn is enough to fill us with dread. It doesn't matter that most of the time nothing at all is waiting."

**Corner vs. Door:**
- Doors are abrupt reveals (open/closed)
- Corners are gradual reveals (continuous unfolding)
- Corners allow hesitation; doors demand commitment

## The Four Doors of P.T.

### 1. The Ratchet Door (Entrance/Exit)
One-way passage. You can only go forward.

**Purpose:**
- Eliminates backtracking as possibility
- Forces players to face what's ahead
- Removes problem-solving distraction ("maybe there's another way")
- Focuses attention entirely on dread

> "The implacable barrier of the one-way door behind us removes the temptation to treat our situation as a puzzle to be solved."

### 2. The Valve Door
Blocks progress sometimes. Visually obvious when locked.

**Why separate from ratchet:**
- Clear visual state (locked or open) from anywhere
- Player knows immediately if blocked
- No wasted time checking
- Keeps attention on *what to do*, not *whether blocked*

### 3. The Bathroom Door
Source of specific horrors. Sometimes open, sometimes locked.

**The Bathroom as Intensified Corner:**
- Everything bad comes from here
- Opening it requires crossing threshold into darkness
- Game trains players to fear it through early jump scares
- When forced inside, door closes—player feels they're *hiding*, not *trapped*

### 4. The Front Door (Impossible Escape)
Never opens. Permanently locked. But always visible.

**Purpose:**
- Reminder that escape *exists* as a concept
- Tantalizingly close, never achievable
- Amplifies horror by showing what you can't have
- Without it, players might forget escape is even possible

> "If you want players to feel trapped, you need to tantalize them with escape routes."

## Repetition and Training

### The Loop Mechanism
P.T. sends players through the same corridor repeatedly. At first, this is boring. Then:

1. Something changes (jump scare)
2. Players learn: changes happen in second half
3. Future loops: anticipation builds before corner
4. The corridor itself becomes the scare

### Training Dread
Early loops establish expectations:
- First half = safe
- Corner = transition
- Second half = danger
- Bathroom = source of danger

Once trained, the game can scare without doing anything. The player's imagination does the work.

## The "Played Out" Problem

### Static Threats Lose Power

The fetus in the sink:
- First glimpse: genuinely horrifying
- After 30 seconds: unsettling
- After 2 minutes: just furniture

> "The longer we're trapped in the bathroom with it, the less scary the fetus becomes—it's played out as a locus of interpretive play."

### Preventing Play-Out

1. **Evolve the threat** — Movement, change, escalation
2. **Limit exposure** — Brief glimpses, then gone
3. **Keep it ambiguous** — Never fully explained
4. **Multiple encounters** — Same threat in different contexts

### The Lisa Ghost (Done Right)
- Appears in multiple places
- Always brief encounters
- Retreats into darkness before becoming familiar
- On balcony: visible only if you look up at right moment

---

## Architectural Horror Techniques

### Visible/Invisible Balance
- Balcony: Not in normal sightline, but visible if you look
- Creates paranoia about unseen spaces
- When something appears there, retroactive fear ("it was there all along")

### Darkness as Canvas
- Black windows in corridor
- Dark back of balcony
- These are blank spaces for imagination to fill

### Misdirection Objects
- Coat rack positioned to look human from corner of eye
- Cluttered surfaces invite close inspection (reducing peripheral awareness)
- Environmental details that distract from actual threats

---

## The Metaphysical Claustrophobia

Horror games thwart agency deliberately:
- Movement is slow
- Aiming is inaccurate
- Weapons are ineffective
- Escape is impossible

**This creates "possibility space claustrophobia":**
- Not just trapped in space
- Trapped in *options*
- All choices feel bad
- No good move exists

> "You feel trapped in a too-small possibility space. Your options for action all feel dangerous and uncertain."

## Design Framework for Horror Levels

### 1. Create Stillness
Reduce interactive demands. Let players think, imagine, dread.

### 2. Hide What's Ahead
Corners, darkness, closed doors. The unknown is scarier than the known.

### 3. Establish Then Subvert
Train expectations, then break them. But not too often.

### 4. Limit Exposure
Brief glimpses of horror, not extended encounters.

### 5. Show Impossible Escape
Tantalize with exits that can't be used.

### 6. Use One-Way Progress
Eliminate backtracking as an option.

### 7. Make Blocking Visible
If players can't progress, make that clear—don't waste dread on uncertainty about state.

### 8. Interpret Actions for Players
When players can't act, design so their inaction *feels* like a choice.

## Key Principle

> "Level design is not merely a matter of arranging things for players to do. It's also a matter of constructing situations that encourage players to hold still while they plan or interpret."

The scariest moments in horror games aren't jump scares. They're the seconds before the jump scare that never comes.
